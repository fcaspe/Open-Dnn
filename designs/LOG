alexnet_v2: First complete synthesis with no FC. Closes timing at 100MHz.
For original CloudDnn VU118P board

alexnet_v3: Testing with FC network added. Accelerator parameters resemble
to the published by the paper. (just the first accelerator is different.)
It fails routing, so we have only synthesis reports. It utilizes 90% of DSPs.
